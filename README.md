<h3>About Project</h3>
<p>This is a basic communication web application which is designed using basic web front-end and django python framework. This is a group video calling web application which allows nearly 10-12 members to communicate through video chat by joining a specific room. A user in this application can either create a room or join an already existing room by entering the room code or name. The user is given privilege to turn on and off the camera and microphone during the call. This project is built using the concept call WebRTC. This functionality is achieved using the Agora SDK.</p>

<h3>WebRTC</h3>
<p>WebRTC stands for Web Real-Time Communication. It is an open source and free project that used to provide real-time communication to mobile applications and web browsers with the help of API’s(Application Programming Interface). This project emerged as a new standard which extends the web-browsing model by enabling the browser in a peer-to-peer manner. JavaScript API’s, HTML5 tags, underlying communication protocols etc. were defined by the W3C(World Wide Web Consortium) and IETF(Internet Engineering Task Force) jointly in order to make a trustworthy communication channel between the future web browsers. Basically, the main idea was to define the WebRTC API which allows the secure access to the input peripherals such as microphones and webcams on a device to share or exchange the media-data, real-time data with a remote device in a peer-to-peer manner.</p>
